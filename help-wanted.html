                    <h3>Revenue share as the starting point</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many of our early-stage projects are <strong>revenue share only</strong> at the beginning.
                        Our recent release <em>Manipulation</em> was built this way from start to finish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You join as a partner alongside the rest of the team, and we’re transparent about scope,
                        expectations, and risk from day one.
                    </p>

                <div class="project-card">
                    <h3>How shares and commitments work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Revenue is typically split <strong>evenly between members, plus one share</strong>.
                        All agreements are contractual and contingent on the game’s completion and release,
                        as well as each member’s ability to deliver on their agreed work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Initial prototype commitments are intentionally tight: most projects only need
                        <strong>2–8 weeks</strong> of focused work for prototyping, playtesting, pitching,
                        or crowdfunding.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="project-card">
                    <h3>If a project is funded</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to secure funding (publishers, crowdfunding, etc.) without asking for
                        excessive unpaid work up front. If a project you helped prototype is funded, you’ll be
                        paid according to <strong>pre-agreed rates</strong> discussed before any commitment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the project is funded and you’re unable to return for full production, you’ll instead
                        receive an agreed-upon <strong>lump sum</strong> for your contribution during prototyping.
                    </p>

            <p class="bio small" style="text-align:center; margin: 28px auto 40px; max-width: 720px;">
                In short, it’s best to assume you <strong>won’t be paid up front</strong>, and to join only if you’re
                comfortable with a revenue-share-first arrangement and the risk that comes with it.
                If that still sounds exciting, we’d love to hear from you.
